# React_Practice

## Project Instructions
________________________

1. Create React app 
2. using react-router-dom make a router in app.js
3. create 3 routes in the router
    a) Signin Page
    b) Register Page
    c) Playground Page
4. Signin Page should contain a form that takes username and password
    therer should be a signin button to submit the form data and redirect the user to the Playground page
    There should also be 2 links on the form "Forgot Password" and "Register"
    The Register link should redirect the User to the Registration page. Dont worry about forgot password for now.
5. Registration Page should contain a form for the user to in put 
    a) Name
    b) Email
    c) Password
    d) a drop down of security questions
    e) an input for security question answer
    f) a button to submit the new user registration form
We will use local storage to store and retrieve the user information which will be similar to a database implementation

6. Playground page: This will be the page in which you will make various react components to learn and practice with various concepts such as state management, Prop passing, callback functions, API calls, life cycle methods and much more 
    
    ### Exercise 1:
        - Create a component that will hold 2 buttons 
            Expected functionality: the buttons should change the 
            background color of the containing div. 
            (i.e. button1 will make the background blue, button 2 will make the background red)
            store the div background color as a state 
            which can be toggled on click event
    
    ### Exercise 2:
        - Create a component that will accept user input as a field when 
        the user clicks a submit button populate that text in 
        the component with Blue text
    
    ### Exercise 3:
        - Create a component that will provide the user with a drop down menu of colors. 
        once the user selects a color change the background color of the containing div 

    ### Exercise 4:
        - Create an component that contains 3 radio buttons and a submit button. 
        Each option can be a topic of your choice. 
        When the user clicks the submit button print the selection to the div.

    ### Exercise 5:
        - Create a component that will provide the user with a drop down menu of colors. 
        once the user selects a color change the background color of the Parent component. 

    ### Exercise 6:
        - Create a component that will provide the user with three radio buttons and a submit button. 
        once the user selects a radio button, change the background color of the parent component.

    ### Exercise 7:
        - Create a component that will accept user input as a field when 
        the user clicks a submit button populate that text in the parent component.
